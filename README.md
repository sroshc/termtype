# termtype
A terminal typing game, has a cool terminal manipulation library

Will work in terminals that support ASCI escape codes and in POSIX compliant environments, i.e linux and macOS 

not compatible on Windows

how to run:
git clone https://github.com/sroshc/termtype.git
cd termtype
make
./output 


- maybe not macOs actually
