termtype

A terminal typing game, has a cool terminal manipulation library.

Will work in terminals that support ASCII escape codes and in POSIX compliant environments, i.e. Linux and macOS.

Not compatible on Windows.
How to run:

    git clone https://github.com/sroshc/termtype.git
    cd termtype
    make
    ./output

    maybe not macOS actually.
